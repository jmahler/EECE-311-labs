% {{{ Objective
\section{Objective}

The objective of this laboratory exercise is to learn and gain
experience analyzing and simulating the behavior of first
order RC or RL circuits and second order RLC circuits under transient
conditions using a SPICE simulator.

% }}}

% {{{ Equipment
\section{Equipment}

To perform the circuit simulation the Ngspice\cite{NGSPICE} SPICE\cite{wiki:SPICE} simulator was used.
Other SPICE simulators such as Pspice\cite{wiki:Pspice} and Orcad\cite{ORCAD}
should work as well.

% {{{ Procedure
\section{Procedure}

The circuit to be analyzed (Figure \ref{fig:circuit}) consists of
resistors, voltage sources, a capacitor, a inductor and a switch.
The switch alternates the capacitor between two parts of the circuit.

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{spice/circuit-01}
\caption{Circuit definition.
Nodes denoted by numbers with 0 as common.
The switch (S1) starts at $t=0^-$ connected from terminals 1 to 2.
At $t=0$ it disconnects from 1 to 2 and connects from 1 to 3.
}
\label{fig:circuit}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, due to the limitations of SPICE, the circuit can not be
implemented directly and instead must be modified.
The first difficulty is that there is no single pole double throw (SPDT) switch
available in SPICE.
An equivalent can be constructed using two single pole single throw (SPST)
switches.
The second problem is that switches cannot be triggered over time.
They can however be triggered by voltage changes and it is possible
to change voltages over time by using a pulse.
In order to read this pulsing voltage without disrupting the circuit being
analyzed an additional circuit will be added.
The modified version of this circuit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:circuit-02}.

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{spice/circuit-02}
\caption{Modification of original circuit definition (Figure \ref{fig:circuit})
to overcome the limitations of SPICE.
S2 and S3 are voltage controlled SPST switches that switch simultaneously.
At $t=0^-$ S2 is closed and S3 is open.  At $t=0$ S2 opens and S3 closes.
VP3 is a pulsing voltage source used to trigger the switches S2 and S3.
R4 is some resistor of arbitrary valued used to establish a measurable
voltage from VP3.
}
\label{fig:circuit-02}
\end{figure}

The SPICE definition is shown in Figure \ref{fig:spice}.

In general a SPICE simulation can be run using Ngspice with the command
\begin{verbatim}
  ngspice -b your_file.cir
\end{verbatim}
where \verb+your_file.cir+ replaced by the name of your file
containing the SPICE definition.
To save the output to a file a redirect can be used as in:
\begin{verbatim}
  ngspice -b your_file.cir > your_file.out
\end{verbatim}

% {{{ Results
\section{Results}

As the switch moves back and forth between its two positions
it produces a waveform of a constant pulse width.
Each transition can be analyzed as a step response with some
initial conditions.
Figure \ref{fig:capv} shows the voltage across the capacitor
during two periods.
It can be seen that there are two components: the under-damped RLC component
which oscillates rapidly and the RC component which gradually changes
decays without oscillation.

over the same time period.
Two periods are shown (1 period equals 40 ms) and steady state conditions
are reached at each point (0, 40 ms, 80 ms).

% {{{ Correlation with theory
\section{Correlation with theory}

To assist conceptually, the two states of the modified circuit
(Figure \ref{fig:circuit-02}) are shown in Figure \ref{fig:circuit-03}.

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{spice/circuit-03}
\caption{The two states of the modified circuit (Figure \ref{fig:circuit-02}).
When the switch is connected to the left hand side the left most circuit
is active and similarly for the right hand side.
}
\label{fig:circuit-03}
\end{figure}

Starting with the left hand side (Figure \ref{fig:circuit-03}) this
circuit is equivalent to a RC circuit with a forced voltage.
Construction of the equation for the step response of an RC circuit
results in Equation \ref{eq:rcstep}.
Substitution a time period of 20 ms results in a value of 22.1 volts
which is nearly the same as the value in Figure \ref{fig:capv}.

\begin{align}
	\frac{dv_C}{dt} + \frac{v_C}{R C} &= \frac{I_s}{C} \notag \\
	v_c &= I_s R + (V_0 - I_s R) e^{-t / RC} \notag \\
	v_c(t) &= (1 mA) (10k) + (100 - (1 mA) (10k)) e^{-t / (10k) (1 uF)} \notag \\
	v_c(t) &= 10 + 90 e^{-100 t} \label{eq:rcstep}
\end{align}


The right hand side of (Figure \ref{fig:circuit-03}) behaves like a
under-damped series RLC circuit with a forced component as can be seen by the rapid
oscillations in Figure \ref{fig:capv}.
And solving this circuit results in the equation \ref{eq:rlc}.

\begin{align*}
	\alpha &= \frac{R}{2L} \\
			&= 250 \\
	\omega_0 &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{L C}} \\
			&= 10000 \\
	\alpha &< \omega_0 \quad\quad\quad \mbox{(under-damped)} \\
	\omega_d &= \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \alpha^2} \\
		&= 10.0\e3 \quad \mbox{[rad/s]}
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
	v_c(0^+) &= 22.1 \\
	v_f(\infty) &= 100 \\
	\frac{dv_c(0^+)}{dt} &= 0 \\
	v(0) &= v_f + \beta_1 \\
	\beta_1 &= 22.1 - 100 \\
			&= -77.9 \\
	0 &= - \alpha \beta_1 + \omega_d \beta_2 \\
	  &= 1.95\e4 + (10\e3) \beta_2 \\
	\beta_2 &= 1.94
\end{align*}

\begin{align}
	v(t) &= 100 + e^{-250 t} \left[ -77.9 \cos(10\e3 t) + 1.94 \sin(10\e3 t) \right] \label{eq:rlc}
\end{align}

And substituting values in to Equation \ref{eq:rlc} shows that it behaves
approximately according to figure \ref{fig:capv}.
